## Important Note for Fixing CSS and Build Issues

To fix the CSS not loading issue and build errors, please delete the following from the root of this project directory:

- The `node_modules` folder (this folder contains all installed packages)
- The `package-lock.json` file (this file locks package versions)

These are located in the same directory as this README.md file.

After deleting these, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will reinstall dependencies and start the development server with the fixes applied.

If you need help deleting these files or running the commands, please ask.
