# Public Folder

This folder is used to store static assets such as images, icons, and other files that need to be served directly.

To add your Leoni photo:

1. Create this folder `public` at the root of your project if it does not exist.
2. Place your image file inside this folder, for example `leoni-logo.png`.
3. Reference the image in your code with `/leoni-logo.png`.

Example:

```tsx
style={{ backgroundImage: "url('/leoni-logo.png')" }}
```

Let me know once you have added the image or if you want me to help with the next steps.
